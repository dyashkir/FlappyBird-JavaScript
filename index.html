   <canvas id="canvas" width="288" height="512"></canvas>

   <p>Code for this can be found at <a href="https://github.com/dyashkir/FlappyBird-JavaScript">https://github.com/dyashkir/FlappyBird-JavaScript</a> original game can be found at <a href="https://github.com/CodeExplainedRepo/FlappyBird-JavaScript">https://github.com/CodeExplainedRepo/FlappyBird-JavaScript</a> there is a video tutorial there as well. I modified the game a bit to make it simpler to inspect with the browser.</p>
   <p>You can open you browser Develop menu and click on inspect to see what game is doing. Logic is in flappyBird.js</p>
   <h4>Can you hack the game and make the score not reset when bird hits the pipe?</h4>
